#
# **NOTE
#
# There is no "non-project mode" simulation Tcl flow in Vivado, the "non-project mode" flow
# requires to call standalone xvlog/xvhdl, xelab and xsim executables from the command-line
# or inside a GNU Makefile.
# However in "non-project mode" the simulation can't be re-invoked from the GUI after RTL
# or testbench changes, thus requiring to exit from the GUI and re-build the simulation
# from scratch. This happens because XSim doesn't keep track of xvlog/xvhdl and xelab flows.
#
# In order to be able to "relaunch" a simulation from the XSim GUI you necessarily have to
# create a project in Vivado or to use a "project mode" Tcl script to automate the simulation.
# The overhead of creating an in-memory project is low compared to the benefits of fully automated
# one-step compilation/elaboration/simulation and re-launch features.
#
# This **CUSTOM** Tcl-based simulation flow basically reproduces all compilation/elaboration/simulation
# steps that actually Vivado performs "under the hood" for you without notice in project-mode.
# Most important, this custom flow is **PORTABLE** across Linux/Windows systems and allows
# to "relaunch" a simulation after RTL or testbench changes from the XSim Tcl console without
# the need of creating a project.

   # **IMPORTANT
   #
   # If the RTL design to be simulated already contains Xilinx primitives (e.g. IBUF, OBUF etc.)
   # then pre-compiled simulation libraries e.g. UNISIM, SIMIPRIME, SECUREIP etc. must be referenced
   # in the code using
   #
   #    library UNISIM ;
   #    use UNISIM.vcomponents.all ;
   #
   # at the beginning of each VHDL source file referencing FPGA primitives.
   #
   # As already done for the compilation flow, by using the 'catch' Tcl command the elaboration process
   # will continue until the end despite ELABORATION ERRORS are present inside compiled sources.
   # All elaboration errors are then shown on the console using 'grep' on the log file.
